# Distributing a Widget to Students

Materia provides several different methods for widget distribution. The first two are available on the *My Widgets* page, once a widget has been selected from the list. The third option provides the ability to link to a learning tools interoperability (LTI) interface (a standard way of integrating a specific application into a learning management system).

{% include figure.html
	no_thumb="true"
	url="widget_sharing_example_1.png"

%}

## Share Link
The first - and simplest - option for distributing a widget is to copy the URL provided in the widget sharing section of the page as seen above. Provide this URL to your students and once clicked they will be directed to Materia where they can log in and complete the widget.

> Note that the URL for your local institution's copy of Materia will differ from this example.


## Embed Code
The second option is to use the embed code by selecting the *use the embed code* link underneath the widget's URL. This provides you with a block of HTML code that you may copy and paste into an HTML or web page document. This will offer the widget directly in the page containing the embed code, saving students the step of following a link. Students can log in and complete the embedded widget as they would normally.

## LTI Interface
A third option for sharing widgets is available for instructors using a Learning Management System that supports LTI (most do). For example, integrating your  widgets into Instructure's Canvas is covered in the [Embedding in Canvas](/embedding-in-canvas.html) section.

> LTI integrations may require some technical setup from your Materia administrators.
