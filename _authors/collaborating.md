# Sharing Widgets with Others

Sharing widgets will allow you to collaborate with others to build your widget, distribute to students, and collect score results.

## The Collaboration Dialog

To share a widget, select it on the *My Widgets* page and click *Collaborate*.

	url="collaboration_button.png"
	alt="Screen shot of widget collaboration button"
%}

## Searching for Users

To find a user, type their name or email address into the *Add people* input box at the top of the Collaboration dialog. Materia will search for that user as you type, providing matched results from which you can select.

> Note that you can only share with users that are current instructors in Materia.

## Collaboration Options

### Full

Grants the user complete control. In addition to distributing the widget to students and receiving scores, the user may edit, copy, or delete the widget, as well as add or remove others from the list of collaborators.

### View Scores

Allows the user to distribute the widget among students and receive scores. However, the user cannot edit, delete, or copy the widget.

### Expiration

You may set an expiration for each person's permissions. After this date, the collaboration will be revoked and the user will no longer have access to the widget.

> Keep in mind that users with the *Full* permission level may edit their own expiration date.
