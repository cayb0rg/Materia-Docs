## Details

### Word/Phrase Board

As you guess correctly, tiles will fill in to eventually reveal the entire word or phrase.

### Keyboard

Click on the keys on this keyboard to submit a guess. You can also type on your physical keyboard and the letters/numbers on the virtual keyboard will lighten to indicate which have already been used.

### Submitting

When you've answered all of the questions you'll be presented with a button to submit your results and review how you did.
