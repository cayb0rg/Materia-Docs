## Details

### Finding words

As you circle words on the board, the word will be crossed off in the word list. You circle words by first clicking on the board, from the beginning or end of the word, to start a selection. You then drag and drop at the other side of the word to complete the selection.

### Submitting

When you've found all the words click the **Done button** to submit your answers and review how you did.
