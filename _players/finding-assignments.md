# Where Do I Find My Assignments?

## Direct Play URL

Students cannot find widgets assigned to them from the Materia site. Instead, widgets are shared with students by sending a play url. It is the responsibility of the instructor to share the play url with his or her students. In many cases, widget play urls are distributed through course materials or email.

## Play History

Your entire play history is available on your profile page. It lists all widgets for which you have earned a score. Read more in the
[Viewing Scores]({{ site.baseurl }}/play/viewing-scores.html) section.
