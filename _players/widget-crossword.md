## Details ##

### Clue Selected State ###

After clicking on a clue in the clue list, two buttons appear underneath the selected clue.

**Get Hint** will provide you with a hint (if hints are provided for the widget), using one of your remaining hints. Using a hint also reduces the score for the clue by a percentage set in the settings by the creator.

Clicking the **Free Word** button will automatically fill in the word (if free words have been provided).

### Submitting ###

Clicking **Finish** will submit your puzzle and take you to the score screen to review how you did.
