# Installing Materia into Instructure's Canvas #

## Setting up Canvas ##

First, take a look at [Instructure's tutorial](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-3020) which covers adding an extension to Canvas. You'll enter the following settings into the **Edit External Tool** form:

* **Consumer Key**: key as defined in configuration file
* **Shared Secret**: secret as defined in configuration file
* **Configuration Type**: By URL
* **Configuration URL** `https://<YOUR MATERIA LOCATION>/lti`

> It is very important you keep the shared secret... well, secret.  These are defined in the configuration files described below.

## Materia LTI Configuration Files ##

The default configuration is in `/fuel/app/packages/modules/lti/config/lti.php`, and your environment's config would be `/fuel/app/packages/modules/lti/config/<ENVIRONMENT>/lti.php` (Where `<ENVIRONMENT>` is a valid environment name)

> Fuelphp uses environments to enable different configuration options in production or development.  For more information view the <a href="http://fuelphp.com/docs/general/environments.html#/env_config">Fuelphp Documentation covering Environments</a>

## Materia Configuration ##

### Name Your Materia Install ###
Generate a unique identifier for your install in the `lti.tool_consumer_instance_guid` configuation setting.

``` php
// Settings for this particular install
// Change the tool_consumer_instance_guid to something unique to your install!
'tool_consumer_instance_guid' => '<SOME_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER>',
'tool_consumer_info_version'  => '1',
// ...
```

### Add a Consumer ###
The configuration file defines which consumers can connect to Materia. For Canvas you need the following:

``` php
'canvas' => [
	// these display in the consumer's dialogs
	'title'             => 'Materia Widget Assignment',
	'description'       => 'Add a Materia Widget as an assignment',

	// the platform that this lti consumer is intended to match up with
	'platform'          => 'canvas.instructure.com',

	// When receiving a launch message, what fields do we use as a user identifier?
	// remote_identifier is the key of the lti data sent
	// local_identifier is the name of the user property to match
	// to use email instead of sourcedid, remote = 'lis_person_contact_email_primary' and local = 'email'
	'remote_identifier' => 'lis_person_sourcedid',
	'local_identifier'  => 'username',

	// if the incoming user is not in our database, should we create it?
	'creates_users' => false,

	// If true Materia will use the incoming user's roles for access,
	// otherwise Materia will only consider the roles it has internally
	'use_launch_roles' => true,

	// which auth driver will do the final work authenticating this user
	'auth_driver'       => 'SimpleAuth',

	// Should we bother saving the assocation of the chosen widget to the resource
	// most LTI consumers do not actually know which widget they are requesting
	// But Materia has an optional message that can request a specific widget
	'save_assoc'        => true,

	// How many seconds should the oauth token be valid since created
	'timeout'           => 3600,

	// Define the privacy level this integration to the consumer
	// public
	'privacy'           => 'public',

	// Security Settings CHANGE THESE!!!
	'secret'            => 'secret',
	'key'               => 'key',
],
```
